        <p>The Incan empire began in Cusco valley sometime between 1000-1400 CE. The empire first began its expansion efforts in 1438 CE under the Incan ruler Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui which translates to ‘Reverser of the World.’ </p>
        <p>The empire grew quickly as they conquered other civilizations in Peru and stretched across the Andes mountains. Thupa Inca Yupanqui succeeded Pachacuti and expanded the empire 2,500 miles during his reign.</p>
        <p>At its height, the Incan empire stretched from present day Quito, Ecuador in the North and Santiago, Chile in the south. It spread across present day Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina for a total length of 3,400 miles. The empire ruled 10 million subjects who spoke 30 different languages, implemented a system of tax and administration, and had a city center in Cusco.

      <div class="flex art-info">
        <p class="art-content">The Inca had a strong eye for design, which can be seen from their impressive stonework to their detailed craftsmanship. Art was extremely important in the empire, as it helped assert the Inca’s dominance over their ruled subjects. Wool from llamas, alpacas, and vicunas were used to create intricate textiles. While the Inca imposed a structure for textile designs across the empire, they allowed cultures to maintain their traditional colors and motifs. Watch the video below to see how tradition runs deep in textile creation.</p>
